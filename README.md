Hosted Link : https://dribbble-clone-ghrkjfkaa-prabanjanjeyasankars-projects.vercel.app/

## Project Overview
This project is a clone of **Dribbble**, a popular platform for showcasing and discovering creative work. I created this project as part of my learning journey in **ReactJS** to enhance my understanding of component-based architecture, state management, routing, and modern web development practices.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to:
- Deepen my understanding of **ReactJS** by building a fully functional web application.
- Explore core React concepts such as **Hooks**, **component composition**, **state management**, and **React Router** for page navigation.

## Features
- **Homepage** that displays a list of creative works (similar to Dribbble).
- **User profile pages** showing specific users' uploaded projects.
- **Project detail pages** where individual projects are showcased.
- **Search and filter** functionality for browsing different categories of creative work.
- **Responsive design** to provide a seamless experience across devices.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation and routing between pages.
- **CSS Modules**: For component-level styling.
